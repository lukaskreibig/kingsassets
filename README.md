## About the project

 This was the final test of my 5 months full-time bootcamp experience at Wild Code School in July 2021. We had one day to build a fully working Full-Stack App with working Frontend and an API using Javascript, Node and Express, MySQL. I built a "treasurer" App for an imaginary King, to keep track of his assets.
